# 🎓 Academic Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my academic portfolio — a curated collection of university projects that demonstrate my skills in algorithm design, data structures, numerical methods, statistical computing, and systems-level programming. Each project folder contains self-contained implementations, documentation, and tests designed to reflect real-world coding and problem-solving approaches.
